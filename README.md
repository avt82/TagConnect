TC2030-MCP-NL to JLink Segger adapter

TagConnect (www.tag-connect.com) cables are very nice, but pretty expensive for hobbyists.
Due to I am dealing with a big variety of microcontrollers, I bought 10-pin cable for ARM Cortex, and 6-pin cable for Microchip ICD.
In this project, here's the PCB of adapter for connecting TC2030-MCP-NL cable to Segger JTag for ARM Cortex.
